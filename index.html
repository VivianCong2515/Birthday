								I remember that you decided to stay in when the rest of your family went out because the sun made you tired and I realized that was a very Vivian thing of you to say. So, you decided to stay home and drink good coffee in a bathrobe. Also, many Mexican dudes hit on you but I'm happy that you chose ME (fk em).

								This is when I ate some $128042 Omakase sushi and we practiced what would happen if a kidnapper picked you up and took you hostage. I'm very happy I get to go home and see my little chimpanzee who escaped the zoo. Also, the video doesn't show you kneeing my chin so hard my teeth probably experienced trauma. Also, I have the world's most fuckin stank ass laugh with you I swear, fuck my life.

						<h2>Finally:</h2>
						<p>
								I really just wanted to make this website to show how much I love you. I know I'm not great with aesthetic and design, but I was planning on making this website for us to build together as we built more memories together. I know you are a little bit of a CODER so I thought you might enjoy to add some pictures in also, but I can also just add them in if you like. I really just wanted to say that I'm really in love with you and I'm sorry that you put up with a lot of dumb things. I also know I'm not that romantic, but I'm trying to really express that I love you and that I want to spend many more birthdays together :). I can't wait for banquet to see you all boujee'd up and really just want to graduate so we can finally be together. Happy 21st birthday my love.
